### Orca Pages

Orca Pages is a JAMstack web hosting platform designed to make it easy for open source projects and nonprofits to get online. Built in Elixir, it is based on a custom CDN and Anycast DNS with an integrated content management system. We are planning to release the alpha version in mid-2025.
