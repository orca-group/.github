### Orca Pages

Orca Pages is a JAMstack web hosting platform designed to make it easy for open source projects and nonprofits to get online. Built in Elixir, it is based on a custom CDN and Anycast DNS with an integrated content management system.

**Originally, we were planning for a mid-2025 release. However, I do not have the funds available to get this project off the ground yet. I realized that, since we have no idea what infrastructure we will be using or what our network will look like, it is impossible for us to start building out any software.**

**At some point in the future, I would like to come back to this project. However, I am finishing out high school and will be starting college soon, so I have no idea what kind of time I will have to keep working on open source software. Regardless, if you are still interested in supporting you can [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/lukewhrit).**
